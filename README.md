Hybrid Emotional Agent with LLM Integration                     Sep 2025 ‐ Present
(Personal R&D Project)
Developing a hybrid intelligent agent by integrating emotion modeling, cognitive appraisal theory, reinforcement learning, and large language models (LLMs) to achieve emotionally-driven interaction.


Hybrid Emotional–Cognitive Agent with LLM Integration

This project explores how emotional models, cognitive appraisal mechanisms, reinforcement learning, and large language models can be combined to build an adaptive interactive agent.
The system maintains internal emotional states, learns from user interactions, updates expectations through prediction errors, and generates context-aware responses using an LLM.
Core components include emotion dynamics, appraisal-based modulation, drive-based motivation, RL policy learning, and a lightweight hybrid LLM conditioning pipeline.
